Theory of Computation (Fall 2020): Application Challenge #3
Dylan Wu, Whitman College


#### How to use:
Simply run `node simulate.js`

This will simulate 3 different built-in PDAs and one PDA that was generated from a CFG.
It will run a series of string tests on each, and output the results.
The `automata.js` file is where you can find the built-in PDAs.
The CFG CNF parsing (A&B addition) is in the `parse_cngf.js` file.
The `tests.js` file contains all of the test strings for each PDA.
